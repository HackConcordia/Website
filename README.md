Make a Node application whenever the mood strikes, without any tedious setup!

It's an acronym!

## Notes

- If you have any problems, please create an issue!
- The sass folder structure is one I find myself using fairly often, feel free to tear it up and make your own structure!
- This boilerplate also contains references to [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and Adam Kaplan's [grid](http://www.adamkaplan.me/grid/).
- Special thanks to
  - robrighter's [node-boilerplate](https://github.com/robrighter/node-boilerplate/blob/master/initproject.sh) for giving me the scripting setup idea
